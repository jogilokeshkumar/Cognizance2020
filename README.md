# Programming language

<!-- strong -->
**A programming language** is a formal language comprising a set of instructions that produce various kinds of output. Programming languages are used in computer programming to implement algorithms.Some languages are defined by a specification document (for example, the C programming language is specified by an ISO Standard) while other languages (such as Perl) have a dominant implementation that is treated as a reference. Some languages have both, with the basic language defined by a standard and extensions taken from the dominant implementation being common.

* C
* SQL
* JAVA
* PYTHON


# 1. C LANGUAGE:
The C programming language was developed in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kernighan at the AT&T Corporation for programming computer operating systems. It uses a compact notation and provides the programmer with the ability to operate with the addresses of data as well as with their values. This ability is important in systems programming, and C shares with assembly language the power to exploit all the features of a computerâ€™s internal architecture. 

# 2. SQL :
SQL (structured query language) is a language for specifying the organization of databases (collections of records). Databases organized with SQL are called relational, because SQL provides the ability to query a database for information that falls in a given relation. 

# 3. JAVA:
In the early 1990s, Java was designed by Sun Microsystems, Inc., as a programming language for the World Wide Web (WWW). Although it resembled C++ in appearance, it was fully object-oriented. In order to be portable, Java programs are translated by a Java Virtual Machine specific to each computer platform, which then executes the Java program.
# 4. PYTHON:
The open-source language Python was developed by Dutch programmer Guido van Rossum in 1991. It was designed as an easy-to-use language, with features such as using indentation instead of brackets to group statements. Python is also a very compact language, designed so that complex jobs can be executed with only a few statements.
